## Overview

The **Hopf Hive Neural Network Model** is an innovative, distributed, and adaptive AI framework inspired by the topological properties of the Hopf fibration. Designed to facilitate complex, non-overlapping, and interwoven data pathways, the model comprises semi-autonomous nodes or "hives" operating within a 4D structure. This project aims to achieve scalable distributed learning, collaborative knowledge sharing, and dynamic adaptation, paving the way toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through recursive self-improvement.

## Features

- **Distributed Learning:** Enables simultaneous and scalable task handling across multiple nodes.
- **Collaborative Knowledge Sharing:** Facilitates rapid and effective sharing of learned parameters and feature embeddings between nodes.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Allows nodes to autonomously adapt, grow, replicate, or prune based on performance and task demands.
- **Recursive Self-Improvement:** Integrates mechanisms for nodes to iteratively enhance their own architectures and algorithms.
- **4D Hopf Fibration Structure:** Organizes nodes in a non-overlapping, interwoven manner to support high-dimensional interactions.
- **Safety and Control Mechanisms:** Implements robust oversight to ensure alignment with human-defined objectives and prevent unintended behaviors.
